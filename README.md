HTML5 Image uploader
====================

Introduction
------------

HTML5 Image uploader is a jQuery plugin to crop, scale and upload an image. It croppes the selected image at the predefined
perspective and scales it down to fit automatically. For efficiency, cropping and scaling is performed at the client
side in the browser. The resulting image is uploaded to the server through an asynchronous call. It exploits all of HTML5's
possibilities, available in every modern browser.

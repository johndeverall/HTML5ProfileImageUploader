HTML5 photo upload
==================

Introduction
------------

Drag 'n drop your photo (and leave the technical details to us)

HTML5 photo upload is a jQuery plugin to crop, scale and upload an image. It croppes the dropped or selected image at the predefined
resolution and scales it down to fit automatically. For efficiency, cropping and scaling is performed on the browser side. The
resulting image is uploaded to the server through an asynchronous call. This plugin exploits all of HTML5's possibilities, available in every modern browser.

Files are automatically uploaded as soon as they are added, no files are stored on the server.
